This is a toy compiler for a toy VM I'm working on as part of my assessment for the SPS module at Liverpool Hope University.
The idea behind it is that it reads from an assembly language that's structured in a JSON document. From there, it's compiled
into a binary format and fed into a VM I'll eventually write.

Yes, it's a horrendous idea. No, there's absolutely no utility. I'm just doing it for the lolz.

Any questions? Email me at me at matthewhughes dot co dot uk
